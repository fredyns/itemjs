## ðŸš€ Your Development Case Study

We'll use your **ItemJS application** as our primary learning example. This app demonstrates:

### Key Features Analyzed:
- **3D Model Viewer** (`ThreeViewer.tsx`) - Complex component with external libraries
- **Item Management** (`ItemsIndex.tsx`) - CRUD operations and pagination
- **Item Details** (`ShowItem.tsx`) - Data fetching and modal management
- **Dashboard** (`Dashboard.tsx`) - Statistics and quick actions

### Technologies Covered:
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Path

### For Laravel Developers:
1. **Start with JavaScript Basics** - Understand the differences from PHP
2. **Learn React Fundamentals** - Component-based thinking vs. Blade templates
3. **Practice with Real Examples** - Use your ItemJS app as reference
4. **Build Understanding Gradually** - Each tutorial builds on the previous

### Recommended Order:
1. Read the Project Overview to understand the codebase
2. Work through JavaScript Basics if you're new to modern JS
3. Follow the React tutorials in sequence
4. Reference your actual code files alongside the tutorials
5. Experiment with modifications to reinforce learning

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- **Compare with Laravel**: Each tutorial includes comparisons to Laravel concepts
- **Hands-on Practice**: Try modifying your actual code as you learn
- **Build Incrementally**: Don't try to understand everything at once
- **Ask Questions**: Use the concepts in your real development work

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Laravel and PHP
- Familiarity with HTML and CSS
- Your ItemJS project setup and running

Let's begin your React journey! Start with `00-project-overview.md` to understand your codebase structure.
